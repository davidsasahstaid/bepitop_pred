# Predicting Immunogenicity for Therapeutic Proteins

This repository contains datasets, code and machine learning models used to predict **immunogenicity** for therapeutic proteins. Predicting  the binding and presentation of epitopes to B- Cells is an important step toward the development of specific therapies.

## Background

**Immunogenicity** is the ability of an antigen to provoke an immune response. *Antigens* are short peptides recognized by specif proteins of the immune systems, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The presentation of both class I and II *epitopes* (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system) are critical for the induction of a sustained effective immune response but also to prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies (ADA).



## Project Description and  Organization

> The aim of the project is to collect data and develop a robust Machine Learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of peptides.

Data were downloaded from the original datasets used for training and testing existing predictors. The purpose is to use this data for train and evaluate inhouse ML models and to use already developed tools as baseline for performance comparison.
